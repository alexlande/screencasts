      This is my attempt to build a simple responsive photo grid in under 5:20.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      First I start off by cloning tachyons into a new folder called tops.
      Then I run npm install . && npm start so that I can get going while all
      the packages install - and npm start will kick off exactly when it's done.
      Running npm start triggers a browser to open that is now set to reload everytime
      you save a file. This gives me a quick feedback loop I find invaluable while
      doing responsive design.
    </p>
    <p class="serif">
      At the end I notice that the grid looks messy and unintentional due to the number of photos.
      I solve this by setting two to be 50% with and then having a row of 4 above that. Not an ideal solution,
      but I didn't have much time to think of much else :)
